**Lessons**

Rmd files for in-class lessons will be posted here. For your notes, you will likely want to create new versions of these lesson files. Saving the lesson under any onther filename will do this. However, if you take notes on the lesson as it is named and do not save under a different filename, YOUR WORK WILL BE LOST.
