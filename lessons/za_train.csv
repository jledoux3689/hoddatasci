I've been lurking here for several months, and for some reason this was the first place that popped in mind since I got home.

Me and my Sister were in a car wreck last Thursday.

1287,N/A,False,1,6,True,t3_hz7vk,17,"Hey Reddit, I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.

But now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.

I rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.

It's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.

I must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to ""pay-it-back"" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).

While I can't promise anything, I might be able to make a picture for you. Providing you want me to.

Anyway? Anyone out there who feels very generous?

257,N/A,False,0,7,False,t3_lit9l,12,"Hi Everyone!

First time requester here and thanks for reading. I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)

About 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.

After about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. 

It's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. 

By the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).

I met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. 

For his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.

So, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. 

I hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. 

Fast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.

I try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.

One day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY","Hi Everyone!

Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.

So, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. 

I hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. 

Fast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.

I try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.

One day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY","[Request] In Chicago with a request, though not for me...",254.42599537,1032.09930556,0,777.631643519,84,494,0,6,11,44,0,1,21,True,"[AdviceAnimals, AskReddit, HeroesofNewerth, LGBTrees, WTF, askscience, aww, chicago, conspiracy, funny, gaming, occupywallstreet, pics, politics, reddit.com, science, space, starcraft, todayilearned, trees, worldnews]",512,9174,936,57014,shroom,heybigpancakes,1319130233,1319126633,1,512,254.42599537,0,7,21,11,0,First Post,No student,824,Poor not in post,Grateful not in post,16

We have been trying to make it by doing work for people online, like building websites, writing articles, building backlinks, and so on. It's been tough, however, because for every legit job we get, it seems someone else tries to get over on us. For the sake of our children, though, we push on.


I don't want to go into all the details publicly, but it's really hard for us these days. We're barely scraping by. We're just a day or two away from homelessness (you can PM for more info), and what's worse is that we can't get any help. We've tried, and been turned away. It's sad. When you need help, I mean really need it, you can't get it.


For the past couple of days, we've only had enough food for the kids to eat, so we've gone without. As long as they have what they need, we will be okay. They are what matters most to us, and so, we sacrifice for them. We don't get much sleep for worrying and trying to make enough money just to get by. Between the stress and worry, I'm surprised that we can even hold a thought.


I cry sometimes, a lot actually, and I wonder, if our efforts are in vain. It seems like everything is working against us, no matter how hard we push forward, we just can't stay ahead. It's wearing me down, that's for sure, but I know that our breakthrough is coming. Somehow, and someway, we are going to make it.


It's just so tiring to try, and try, and try, and not get anywhere. And what I've told you here is not the half of it. If anyone can help, I will give you the info (verification) that you need of our situation.


I'm just hoping, that at least tonight, someone can help us out. Pizza isn't much, but it's something. And I'll be thankful for it. It will help us to get through another tough night, just a little easier.

I'm just hoping, that at least tonight, someone can help us out. Pizza isn't much, but it's something. And I'll be thankful for it. It will help us to get through another tough night, just a little easier.

See, around here the apartment companies build up this hype that all of the best apartments will be gone if you don't sign on Oct 5th. This is such shit! We were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . By perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are ""left"" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per PERSON for these shit holes.

A friend I actually met through a couch surfer I hosted has become like a surrogate dad to me and is flying here from California to drive me down- he is an incredible person and I owe him my life. He does so much for me and has agreed to drop everything to make sure I get the care I need to get well. 

Anyhow, he is paying for everything for this trip- including the visit if I can't get any financial aid help (have submitted an application) as I don't have insurance. I can't tell you how blessed I am to have this man in my life. 

Other than gratitude I have nothing to offer him as I am very broke due to my illness keeping me from working despite trying desperately to get well enough to resume my career. 

Can anyone arrange to have a pizza delivered to where we are staying either Sunday night when we are due to arrive or Monday for after my appointment? I think he would appreciate it and I know I would more than words could say!

I am still not sure where we are staying yet or exactly when we are arriving but I can let the giver know the exact details as soon as I know. I am hoping to stay Sunday with a friend from high school in nearby Elkhorn but if not it will be a hotel close to JHMC.

You don't need to do this, but I'd appreciate it. (Plus, I can surprise the fianceé with her half to lessen the blow.  She knows, incidentally.)

Sorry to bother.

**Edit** ... Sorry again. I'm in Ontario, Canada. I'm new to this. Sorry.

**UPDATE**  I didn't get pizza last night. User ""shockey"" helped out (I believe, because my faith in humanity can't let me think that this was a prank) to the point of taking my personal info, but no pizza came.  Around 11pm last night, I noticed that they deleted their user info from Reddit, but tried to ignore the warning flags that come with that.

[Conversation, part 1](http://imgur.com/QkDp5.jpg) and [part 2.](http://imgur.com/ktmYJ.jpg)

Sorry, everyone, for getting your hopes up. I don't know what my fianceé ate last night. It's nearly 5am for me now, so I'll go eat some cereal and make a coffee, and start the day. ~~I'll message the mods here about this~~ (Nope, I have no info and it was only my trust), but only time will tell if we were scammed or not. I hope not.  I sincerely think that it was a first-time gesture that didn't go through.

I really don't mean to bother anyone, and thanks for the words and support you gave. 

**UPDATE 2** Hello, again. Thanks to everyone who messaged their support and well-wishes.

Although we never received pizza from *Random Acts of Pizza*, which has an obstacle regarding cross-border exchanges it seems, it should be noted that *we did have pizza* last night from some old friends of ours who invited us back to our hometown.  It was a great night out and all of us got some great laughs and good social vibes.

*(The first* ""boy pizza"" *had pepperoni, bacon, tomato, and red pepper; the second* ""girl pizza"" *was feta cheese, sundried tomato, red onion, and green olives.  There was also 20 deep-fried wings, ordered with BBQ sauce but supplemented with the home's own Frank Sauce. A jug of Nestle Ice Tea Zero was offered and shared all around.)*

I just want to thank everyone who has offered to assist my fianceé and I in the last few days. She's as astounded and overjoyed at this post as I am, and we thank you all sincerely.  She also keeps nudging me to start accepting some of the gratuity, Since I was fence-sitting because of my morality, ethics, and humility, I've decided to graciously accept a few offers (if still available) via private message. If declined, I fully understand with no ill will.

Once again, thank you, everyone.  You are an awesome community, and we love you.

**TL;DR** Laid off, pizza offer fell through in possible scam (though hopefully not), Reddit comes through with offers and consolation, we get pizza from friends back home.

My boyfriend doesn't have a job (I do, but I get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until June 30th).  The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.  

[Following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy Polish mothers]

Now you may be wondering ""What's wrong with the last part"" in which I will refer you to the crutches.  Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.

Anyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say ""I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.""  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.

     3 cups sugar
     1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)
     2/3 cups of coco
What you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the ""hard ball"" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it.

So, my roommate had told me about this Reddit, and I had planned to keep it in mind to give other people pizza every once in a while. I wasn't planning on using this for me...but I'm in a really tough situation right now. 
A little background: I had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when I lost my dining hall job. I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is ""always hiring"" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food.

I'm attempting to go back to school so I don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven't been getting the best hours. 
According to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it's probably on it's last legs, and today I didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so I don't get any bonuses.
Overall everything's just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I'll be able to cover everything then.

They had told me to ""enjoy a week off for Thanksgiving and spend time with your family."" That was nice, I figured my Christmas bonus will make up for the 40-hour loss. Then I come back ready to work, 2 days later I get the boot. Keep in mind, this is 2 weeks before Christmas bonuses go out. 

So I lost 1 week of pay, no severance, no bonus, and no job. My wife is a full-time college student that isn't even allowed to work (she will lose her scholarships.)

This is going to be a very tight and hungry Christmas for my wife and I. And we would greatly appreciate something good to eat so I can use what money I have left to pay bills until I find another job.

If you need proof, I'd be happy to tell you anything. We are a very generous couple and once I get another job, I would be happy to pay it forward.

Hi reddit. This is my first time ever doing something like this but here I go.

I am requesting a pizza to feed two adults in Westminster MD. My fiancé and i are behind because I broke my ankle in July and have been out of work since because the break required extensive surgery. All pizza chains are equally distant and would require us to pick up.

My fiancé doesn't get paid until next Friday and his parents can only help so much, mostly with money for utilities and prescriptions for both of us. We have maybe $20 to our name and he has a full work schedule next week as well as having to take me to a follow up appointment with my surgeon on Monday, who is located a thirty minute drive away.

We've been eating a lot of PBJs and ramen and our ramen is running out so a pizza could really help out a lot. When we have gotten two pizzas in the past,they have lasted us for three-four days.

It's hard to ask for help, since I put myself here because I want to one day work for Cirque Du Soleil -- instead of just a temporary job working with a show while they are in a city. I plan on trying to follow them for a few more shows and hope the experience helps set my resume apart, as well as that I can practice some aerial arts (trapeze).

I absolutely love the show and the people I am following and it's really the show I want to work for but if I were to actually land a job with Cirque, I honestly would not mind any show.

I've never posted here before - but I fully intend to ""Pizza-It-Forward"" when I'm back on my feet a bit more.  Happy June, everyone!

I've got two younger sisters, a mother going to school full time for her masters (almost there!), and a girlfriend. We all live under the same roof, and here lately, things have been a bit rough. We haven't been grocery shopping in about a month or so, and have no money do to so at the moment. We're holding out for our grants (we all go to school), but unfortunately those will not arrive for another couple of weeks.

This is my first post, and I'm not sure if I'm doin' this right (oh please correct me if I'm doing it wrong!) but here goes, here's why I wish I had a pizza right now (prepare for dramalama): 

**The worst:** I just had to tell this girl, the sweetest, funnest, cutest one you could ever imagine, that I didn't feel the same way about her that she did about me. Yes, I would sing her praises yet don't reciprocate, why? I've known her since we were kids, and since we've grown up, I absolutely can't see her as anything more than a little sister. She's never been quite lucky in love, and every fiber of my being knows she deserves more than a ""no"" from anyone, yet I can't be the one to do it -- I would be lying to myself and to her. Uggghhh, seeing her in this state, and knowing I caused it, is really taking it's toll on me. I've been dreaming about her, and even in my dreams I can't feel the same way, making me wake up only an hour or two into my sleep and unable to go back to sleep due to feeling so miserable. 

**The kind-of okay:** Aside from that, I simply don't have any food in the house right now, and my only ride out of this mountainous region isn't coming until (hopefully?) tomorrow, so that I may go get groceries. 

So, not having pizza in a long-ass time, I feel like one would definitely bring an umbrella to this raincloud party, as well as tie me over until my friend gets back up here. What say you, friend?","Howdy everyone! You doin' alright?

[request] SAP in [California] comes to you in her time of pizza need.

So I am more of a lurker and I know it makes me look bad but I have been here nearly three years and I hope that gives me some credit. (I am great at run-on sentences). 

My little family of two and one cat would love to indulge in a pizza. We have been going through some tough times recently. We just paid the rent and now have 24$ to our name. We are going to do whatever we can to have it hold us over until Wednesday. A pizza is not a necessity but it would be a real treat. 

In exchange I can offer pictures of my adorable cat Charlie (he has plenty of food so there are no worries there) and a promise to pay it forward as soon as I can.

3075,N/A,False,1,2,False,t3_xg56s,2,"Hey there, I am going hungry and would really appreciate a pizza from anyone willing. I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (£9 to last until the end of August).

I went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).

For years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.

This, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates £100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a £970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only £30 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and £40 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her £500).

I've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.

I spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.

Sorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...

But yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha.

Hey everyone, I'd really enjoy a full stomach tonight, my future is looking extremely down, but I have the next four days to enjoy, I'll share my story, it's a little lengthy, but you certainly deserve to know why I'm asking for a meal tonight.

The sparknotes version is that my Dad passed away when I was young, too young to really remember anything about him other then he loved Star Trek. After that, my Mom remarried a man, who was very abusive. We lived on for about a year and then my Mom passed away. Both of my parents had cancer, I don't know if I do or not, I'm not 100% sure on how the genetics work with something like that.

Anyways, I lived with him for about two years until I moved in with a family from a church. They were in their mid 50's, not at all a good age to raise a 12 year old apparently. They were beyond abrasive to me and just wasn't a good fit, but I had no choice. After about three years I moved up north with a family for about four months when they decided they were too young and busy for me. They were in their late twenties and they had just had two kids, again, not a good fit. I was kicked out on a moments notice had my aunt pick me up and drive me back to the cities. My aunt then proceeded to drop me off at her apartment and tell me that no one in my family is willing to take me in. I waited on the curb with all of my stuff, calling friends, until one of their families wanted to take me in. I lived with them for about two years until they decided they needed to move to Iowa, they offered to take me with, but I declined because a friend in school wanted me to graduate with him. I lived there until I graduated.

About a week after I graduated, they had a death in the family and needed to use my room for company. I could certainly understand, so I moved into a place where a guy owns a house and just rents out rooms, found on craigslist. Being seventeen, I didn't have much of an option because most apartment buildings wouldn't allow me to move in being underage.

I started working at a game store that I loved right near by where I lived, it was a place where I would put in like 40-60 hours a week, sometimes paid for overtime, most of the time not. I loved that store, but a year after I started, the store had to close down due to investor issues. I had about a week's notice and the closing day was the day before Christmas Eve. I was unemployed for a few months until I started working at another game store, but they lasted about four months after I started working there. 

Currently, I'm working at a Car Wash while trying to get into something with gaming. I'm not aiming to make it though, I'm in debt to my landlords and I don't make nearly enough money to pay it back currently. I was a bright student, but I've had no opportunity to go to college or anything, I don't have the safety net of a family.

My phone is going to be turned off any minute, I owe Redbox money for a rental that I can't repay (Another stupidly long story), and I owe my landlord $525.00 on Sunday, and I currently have about $4 to my name. I have no where to turn for help, I'm just trying to enjoy the days I have left.

If someone would be willing to make tonight a great night by buying me a meal, I'd be forever grateful. 

Thanks for reading, any words of encouragement would be appreciated too.","Edit: I'm sorry, I forgot to say I live in Minnesota, USA.

Had dental work done recently that took about 190 bucks to fix my teeth. I used my last can of chili beans and mixed it with white rice last night for dinner.

Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone. 

It seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me. I would love a pizza for dinner and with the leftovers, eat for breakfast and lunch. We live in Union City, California in the shadows of both the great Silicon Valley and the San Fransisco Bay.

Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone. 

It seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me. I would love a pizza for dinner and with the leftovers, eat for breakfast and lunch. We live in Union City, California in the shadows of both the great Silicon Valley and the San Fransisco Bay. Right smack in the middle where apartments are tiny but cost you an arm and a leg to live there. 

Thank you guys for taking the time to create such a wonderful service to help your fellow man. I WILL be paying it forward when i get on my feet, if only a simple pie to a struggling family. 

email me at l0serl0ve7@gmail.com if you could help us. If you need proof of something lemme know, i can screenshot my dentist check that cleared or my negative account balance. Thanks again.

i went back to the hospital because of suicadal and depression...(Ive already been once, and this time got diagnosed with bipolar)

gave me a shit tons of medicatinos, (I find out later that were all outdated,  and all had adverse side effects with each other)
missed 3 imporant auditions (I am an actor, missed 1 theater audition and two major film auditions, batman and Avengers)'

As soon as I get released from the hospital, I get a nagging throbbing pain in my side, turns out to be a kidney stone, start pissing blood that wont stop for three week

then drove up to CPH (Cleveland Playhouse) for a callback for their first downtown show (Really big deal in Cleveland) while dealing with a kidney stone
on my way there from Parents house, which is  a two hour drive
my car broke down
so every 20 miles i had to get out, fill it up with water in the heatwave
so i just got more dehydrated which is awful for kidney stones, and just made things incredibly difficult and uncomfortable.

get there to the audition all sweaty, delarious, and dehyrdated
fucked up that audition
drove home, same 20 mile bullshit
go home, get the worst pain of my entire life, THE WORST PAIN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE. Google Kidney stone pain.

While I was in the hospital, I lost my job, (which later turns into cutting hours) because they don't think I am ""reliable and stable"", so due to this, I can't pay rent on a new place, and my lease is up August 1st, so I have to move back home. 
Work decides to give me hours, but only 20hrs a week, and from my parents house, its over an hour and 15 min away. 
then my 2cd week back at work, i got attacked again by kidney stones
got yelled at again from my boss because I ""should have seen the stone coming and not went to work:
Go to the ER, and urologist and they tell me  i have to wait 19 days to get a CT scanto see whats wrong with my kidneys
Get  an email form my old landlord basically saying im not getting my deposit back.

And last night, TO TOP EVERYTHING OFF, someone broke into my truck.

This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.

First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. 

I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)

Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P
We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. 

What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. 

I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P

Lost my job recently and having trouble making ends meet with all of our funds tied up in lawyer and Federal fees for my wife's US citizenship. While I've been blessed with a loving wife and our loyal and hilarious pups, I cannot afford to provide them with anything special during this rough time - even after a humble holiday and stringent budgeting for groceries and supplies from the likes of Aldi and Dollar General. 

Truthfully, I'm ashamed to admit that I've failed so completely in being a good provider for my tiny family and I'm glad we decided to wait on having kids so they don't have to struggle with us. But I also have no illusions about this and I'm well-aware that the responsibility lies squarely in my hands. That said, I know how effective something as simple as a pizza would be in raising the spirits around here so I'm sucking it up and asking for help from a community I've valued for quite some time now.

My wife is vegetarian, so I would request a cheese pizza. My local Dominos is the cheapest I know of and has a coupon for an extra large 1-topping for $9.99 ($13.26 w/tax), which is actually better than the regular price of a large ($14.37 w/tax). There are various other coupons as well, from Dominos Store #2878.

Bonus: my wife would be more than happy to draw the subject of your choice in MSPaint!

2151,N/A,False,0,2,False,t3_yc850,1,"So, about a 2 months ago, I found a job. It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.

I also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.

And then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.

(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) 

My boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.

So, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.

Sorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(

I was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of ""Alright, if you really want to,"" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement ""ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--""


So we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.


So she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word ""Tony"" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.
So I read just the 1 text. It states:
""Tony better remember what you asked for last week.""
My stomach got this twisted feeling of ""oh crap how could I forget."" 


!!!!! 


JUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream ""hey wait!"". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)


I took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.


She has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said ""I thought you forgot!"".


She took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. ""I will love you until the last pepperoni fades."" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.

---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.

Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.  
  
Shortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's ""friend"" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the ""friend"" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.

Naturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's ""friends"" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is ""still on tag"" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also ""on tag"". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.

By this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, ""thanks anyway""s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.

Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!

EDIT: TL;DR, I helped out a criminal repair what was probably a stolen bicycle while surrounded by sketchy people and subsequently had to spend my dinner money on a replacement tool he broke so that I could fix my own ride.","So I'm financially a little shaky right now, as I don't start my new job until September and I just graduated.

The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, ""thanks anyway""s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.

Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!

Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.

*Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*


The project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.

**So here's the thing:**
I'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!

I just moved back to Bloomington after spending the last year taking care of my mother who was suffering from brain cancer. Sadly, she passed away last month, but thankfully is no longer suffering. 

I've been back for about 3 weeks and have been having a very hard time finding work. I assume because it is a college town and during the summer many businesses are cutting staff and hours till the students come back in the fall.

I am working hard to get my life back in order after the loss of my mother and would appreciate from the bottom of my heart if someone was willing to donate a pizza for me to have tonight. My income has been extremely limited since helping to pay for funeral cost, my apartment's deposit and first month of rent, and bills, so any food is a blessing.

I had been working on this massive art project, however I was far behind because no matter what I would do, my teacher would come back saying that personally didn't like it. Not that it wasn't good, she just didn't like it. This put me back roughly 3 days behind everyone else in the class. Come Monday projects are getting turned in, and I don't have mine done because of how far behind I was because of her. She said too bad and told me to better manage my time. Even the other students in the class told her she wasn't being fair and it wasn't my fault. I just say okay, and work to get it in as soon as I can. Tuesday comes. I go into work after class, and go to look at my schedule for the next week. I'm scheduled for 12 hours. I go to ask one of my managers what's up because I literally can't even pay for my gas to drive to work on those hours. Apparently someone decided to start a rumor about me at work that I was tired of working there and that I was bad-mouthing the managers. Instead of coming to talk to me, they listened to the rumors and cut my hours. Wednesday comes around. I'm on my to school when my car starts acting funny. I'm on my way to class, and am almost at the school, so I just try and get the school where I can look at my car. I'm in the parking lot getting ready to pull into a spot when my car dies. Steam starts coming out from under the hood, I knew it had overheated. My temp gauge didn't show it was overheating so it told me that my thermometer was broken. I call my dad and tell him I'm stuck at the school, he says when he gets a chance he'll bring a thermometer up to me and we'd replace it at the school. I wait 20 minutes, start the car up again,  pull into the closest spot, and go to class. I come out from class and look under the hood. Radiator is empty and the resevoir tank is massively overfilled, leading to the thermometer again. I put water in my radiator, and try to start my car; nothing. I try again, hear a loud bang, get a big puff of smoke, and my car dies. I just cracked the engine block, meaning my car is dead. As a side note, my school and work is 40 minutes away one from where I live. I cannot live without having a car. So now I'm having to borrow my dad's car. Next comes Thursday. My parents are going through a very bad divorce, and my dad was having to travel to a different state for the trial. I get a call from him late in the afternoon, in which he's very upset with me. The day before I told my mom about my car, and told her I was using my dad's car, and then she asked how my dad was going to the trial. This was where I made my mistake: I told her that he was using his company credit card. Apparently she used this information in court against him, and it wasn't something even his lawyer knew about. Now my dad is upset with me because he thinks he can't say anything to me because I'll just go to my mom. I'm not talking to my mom right now because she took something I told her because I thought she would be concerned about me and instead just used it to her own advantage. Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.

3205,N/A,False,5,4,False,t3_vlcew,4,"Dear reddit:

I am a long time follower but have only recently just registered. A long story short is I am fucked!!! I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.

A little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.

The job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.
 
I did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.

While working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.

Fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).

While I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.

There I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,

A month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.

See family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!

July 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.

Oh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!

Can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? 

I can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.

Fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).

While I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.

There I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,

A month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.

See family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!

July 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.

Oh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!

Can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? 

I can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.

2654,N/A,False,3,4,False,t3_ktf2k,3,"New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.

 I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.

I've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.

My family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?

So that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day.

Also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse I've been afflicted with I'm selling it on the cheap =)","New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.

 I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.

I've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.

My family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?

It's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  

In exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.

Lately its just been a series of downfalls for me. First to start, my girlfriend left me around october. Right after I got a new job, that was fun. Getting put into the mental ward at the hospital cuz I got so damn depressed that I was gonna kill myself.

The second to come was the reapearance of the scabies i've been trying to get rid of that my ex girlfriend had given to me. She caught them SOMEWHERE and i'm STILL not sure how she got them. The Medicine costs a fortune and i was lucky to get the first tube for pretty much free, but then I lost my insurance.

I've been trying and trying, day after day to make myself feel better - gifting people things like games on steam, pizza to close friends and helping other people like my coworker Ryan whom has a kid and a wife and always eats raman for his break because he's dirt broke all the time.

I don't know what it is, and I sit here, hungry myself, cold cuz I don't have heating in my house because I heat it with propane and I don't even have enough money for that.

On top of it all, today i'm sitting here in pain because on my way to work (which i'm missing today due to this) I got hit by a car. I ride a bike so... You can kinda imagine what thats like. My back rim is mangled, luckily the person who hit me bought me a new rim and got me a ride home, but fuck. I'm just like... STOP THIS NONSENSE!

So all i'm asking for is some pizza guys. Anyone, it don't matter, small pie, it's whatever.

I live in the New Jersey area in Mantua. Pats pizza is my favorite, but i'll go for pizza hut cuz I like most of their stuff too.

Tried calling the bank to settle this matter, but according to them since I had them help me with this before (one that happened because THEY charged me monthly maintenance fees that had never happened before) I was not eligible for them to waive my overdraft fee of $30. So now my account is -$40.16. Luckily I convinced them to stop, and my parents were nice enough to cover the fees for now.

You expect anything but good new, because you prep yourself for worst thing he could possibly say.  You brace yourself in defense of it, for weeks after they draw the blood from your veins.  It builds and builds up until that call.  And then it comes.  That intolerable small talk when the Doctor first gets on the line.  It's a pleasant exchange, though the entire time, you're mind is screaming ""SAY IT, SAY IT DAMN YOU, WHAT DID THE BLOOD LOOK LIKE!?  YOU SAVED MY LIFE BUT I WILL LOSE IT IF WE TALK ABOUT MY COLLEGE OR THE WEATHER FOR ANOTHER MOMENT!"".    

""No changes, which is a good thing"".

Deafening relief.

The world just somehow looks better after this call, it smells better, everything is vivid, clearer, more alive.  Please help me with a celebration meal worthy of this feeling.  My favorite pizza, I do not have the funds for it.  I can think of nothing else right now that I would enoy more than a simple Large Bacon Pineapple Pizza from Dominoes with BBQ sauce instead of marinara.  If it was a wild animal I would hunt it with my instincts and wits alone.  But alas.  If you see fit I thank you for any help you may give.","[request] Massachusetts USA:  5th year anniversary Cancer Free, Pizza would compliment the natural high of the Doctor's news.",865.781539352,1343.43864583,0,477.615439815,514,542,0,3,30,38,0,1,51,False,"[AskReddit, DoesAnybodyElse, Eve, Games, GlobalOffensive, Health, IAmA, LoLCodeTrade, MMORPG, Music, Planetside, RedditBrigade, Steam, SteamGameSwap, TheSimpsons, WTF, atheism, battlefield3, blog, business, canada, comics, dayz, entertainment, evedreddit, fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu, funny, gamernews, gaming, humor, leagueoflegends, movies, news, offbeat, pics, promos, r4r, reddit.com, science, scifi, sex, shutupandtakemymoney, starcraft, technology, television, tf2trade, todayilearned, trees, videos, worldnews, wow]",3024,3136,5278,5528,NA,Metiphis,1345051806,1345048206,0,3024,865.781539352,0,5,51,30,0,First Post,No student,266,Poor not in post,Grateful not in post,-4

It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able. I'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!

Hello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.

I have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.

I've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.

Also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.

So here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.

NOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)

EDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.

They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place.

What I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father.

So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.

I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.

He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.

He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.

Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?

I don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life.

So here's my dilemma guys... My payroll made a mistake on Friday and it was too late to take care of before the next business day (fingers are crossed for tomorrow). The problem is that I literally live paycheck to paycheck a few day late check can really turn your world upside down. I'm starving for a bite to eat tonight and would be so grateful if someone could help me out. After I get my paycheck sorted out I'd be happy to pay it forward or just send a pizza back at you in appreciation. Whatever you want me to do to return the favor, just, please help.

I intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.

So I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this.
I get there and everything is fine for about a day.
He decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.

The next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. 

I'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. 

I'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.
I don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can.
I'm in the eastern PA area. 
Thanks for any help any one can give, it won't be forgotten and will definitely be paid forward.

TL;DR Moved out to PA from NV, was told I had a job, didn't, grandfather went all schizo on me, now I'm staying in a run down trailer behind my uncles friends house, waiting for the paper work for my car so I can scrap it and go back home.

We played for about 2 hours while he asked me questions about when I was in 3rd grade and joked around about Space Chimps. It was the funnest time I've had in a long time and really reminded me about what's important.

We spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.



He needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.



If he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.




So, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.




**TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  This was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24/7 monitoring.  The vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  After we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.  Pizza wold be wonderful.","Our rabbit, Bugs got sick.

My Parents have had a terrible week, and while I would normally buy them dinner at a time like this I'm between paycheques and out of cash.

They are just really in the ""World against us"" point of view. They could really use some love from the world at large, and that is where I was hoping ROAP might come in.

If you guys could find a way to send them some saucy cheesy goodness that would be amazing, and come next friday (Payday) I will be passing it on.

I was also going to stop by a store to grab a bite to eat (food stamps), but that's not possible anymore with this storm. I could really use a warm pick me up reddit. I'm cold, wet, and starving.

My dog Odie is also out of food now, today I fed him some leftover eggs and hashbrowns with gravy, he will also be enjoying the pizza and I will post pictures of this.

My request is for www.screaminmimispizza.com specifically, because it's only a couple dollars more than a regular chain pizza and it will feed me for 2-3 days. My favorite is a pizza w/ eggplant or the bbq chicken pizza w/ ricotta.

Thanks for reading,

Before you all jump on me for being a new member, I hope you will take the chance to read my plea.  Yes, I'm new to the community, no I didn't hear about it through the news reports the other day, but rather heard about it from a family friend.

She has moved back in with her parents, and I'm living in our house with our two children, Jennifer &amp; William.  Along with this added stress, I've just lost my job as a management consultant.  So now I'm left with a broken heart, a hole in my pocket and two hungry kids to feed.

We're not in as terrible of a position as other members on here, but I was wondering if a kind member would be willing to donate a pizza so I can surprise my kids at some point, and hopefully help them get their minds off our current situation.

So here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..

For the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery.
At one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors)
Things were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.
Well. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.

She had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.

So here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house.
BUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong.
So i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.

I can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of..
Thanks in advance.
