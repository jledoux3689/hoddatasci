In Class Work: Plotting Conditional Means
----------------------------

Today we're going to work again with attrition as our outcome. Your company would like to know which groups are most likely to leave this year. Your supervisor has asked you to wtrie a one-page memo, detailing how attrition varies as a function of different employee characteristics. Since your supervisor is a visual learner, the memo should include two graphics, with accompanying brief text. No R code should be visible in the memo, just graphics and normal text. Your supervisor has said that the following areas are of key interest as possible predictors of attrition.

1. Commute distance 
2. Marital Status
3. Gender
4. Work/Life Balance
5. Education level
6. Salary
