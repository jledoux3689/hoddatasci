Classification: Kaggle Competititon, Part Deux
---

Today, we'll be again working in paris on a Kaggle competition to predict who gets pizza. Using the pizza dataset, find the best fit to the data. However, to qualify as a winner, you need to do the following: 

1. Fit a model using logistic regression using the training dataset (pizza_train.csv).

2. Compute the predictions from your model from the testing dataset (pizza_test.csv). 

3. Calculate the AUC (from the Receiver Operating Characteristic) for the predictions from your model from the testing dataset (pizza_test.csv). 

4. Find a way to plot the predictions from your model.
