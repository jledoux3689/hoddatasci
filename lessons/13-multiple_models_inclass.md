# Multiple Models: In Class Exercise

1. Get the `at_train.Rdata` file. This is a file containing information about employees. 
2. Summarize the variable `MonthlyIncome`
3. Create a model to predict `MonthlyIncome`
4. Cross validate that model. 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you find a model with good predictive characteristics.
6. Submit that model to me and I will test it against my held aside testing data. You'll need to commit an R object for your model. I'll grab that object and evaluate it against my testing data.    
7. The group with the lowest RMSE (on log scale) wins.
