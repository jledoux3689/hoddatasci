Assignment 5
----------------

In this assignment, you'll be asked to predict two related items: first, who spends ANY money on cigarettes, according to the CEX. Second, how much do they spend? You'll need to do a few things.

1. Create a binary variable that's set to 1 if the household spent any money on cigarettes and 0 otherwise.


2. Create a model that predicts this variable. 
3. When you're done, write some comments regarding why you think this model is a good one (write this up in paragraph form, using your finely-honed writing skills). According to this model, who spends any money at all on cigarettes?
4. Create a subset of the data that only includes people who spent something (more than 0) on cigarettes. 
5. Using this subset of the data, predict spending on cigarettes among the group who spent more than 0. 
6. Make some equally well-written comments regarding which variables predict expenditures on cigarettes among people who smoke (or at least buy cigarettes). 
7. Calculate the rmse for your model agains the testing version of this data.
