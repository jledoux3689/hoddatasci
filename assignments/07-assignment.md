Assignment 7
---

For this assignment, I want you to use the Census ACS API to download and plot data. Complete the following steps:

1. Download data for all of the zip codes in Los Angeles county on education levels. 
2. Compute the proportion of the population that has a bachelor's degree or above by zip code.
3. Download data for all of the zip codes in LA county on family income by zip code. 
4. Compute the proportion of the population that has family income above 75,000. 
5. Download data for all of the zip codes in LA county on health insurance coverage status (you'll need to look that table up here:[http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/summary-file-documentation.html](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/summary-file-documentation.html).
6. Calculate the proportion of the population in each zip code that is uninsured. 
7. Plot the proportion uninsured as a function of education, and then as a function of income. 
8. Model the proportion uninsured as a function of education, income _and one other variable of your choice_.
