Assignment 6
-----------------
Complete the following steps using the `cex.Rdata` or file. I want you to use the `ggplot` library and commands for all plots. 

1. Choose a dependent variable and plot that dependent variable as a function of a continuous independent variable.
2. If you need to, adjust the scale of either the dependent variable or independent variable to make more sense. 
3. Add a line of best fit to your graphic. 
4. Clean up the labeling and description of the graphic so that it could be presented to a broader audience. 
5. Now, run a regression predicting your outcome as a function of at least two independent variables. 
6. Plot your predictions. Make this plot clearly labeled and easy to read.
7. In your .Rmd file, include a few sentences describing what the graphic above shows.
