What if I like this stuff?
================
Will Doyle

A frequent question I get after this class, is what now?

The good thing about data science is that it is still a very fluid field, so the barriers to entry aren't super high.

You should think of how to develop your skills in three different domains-- I base this on Drew Conway's [data science Venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram).

Coding (aka Hacking)
--------------------

-   First, keep coding! These skills will atrophy if you don't use them. Use R and Rstudio at work. Use it for your next paper. Use it to figure something out in your life.
-   Second, get involved in open source projects. You will learn a ton. Look for people on github doing something that's interesting to you and join them.
-   Many massive online courses are taught in this area, and will be MUCH easier now that you have taken this class
-   CS classes here and elsewhere are great, but many find them tough, and you don't need to be ready to write production code to do really interesting stuff. That said, if you want to get good, CS is the way to go.

Math
----

-   This is the hardest area to do on your own. You should really take more advanced stats courses, including a course on regression, a course on classification, and a course on latent trait analysis. Linear algebra forms the basis for almost all stats and is also super useful for programming, so it too is highly recommended.
-   Take the class pass/fail if you're worried-- the skills are important, not the badge.
-   Generally, people have the toughest time finishing math classes in MOOCs. The good news is there are a TON of them, so you can always try again.

Substantive expertise
---------------------

-   The good news is that this can be aquired in any number of ways: job experience, reading, further education.
-   The bad news is that it's going to take a while. There's no real substitute for time and effort on this one.

Building a portfolio
--------------------

As you develop your skills, create a portfolio on GitHub, showing what you can do. Create [gists](https://gist.github.com/) and post them on your twitter feed and linkedin accounts. Don't just have the skills, show the skills.

Further education
-----------------

Of course, you can get a master's in Data Science from multiple institutions. While these are great, I would recommend you get some experience in the work first.

Research
--------

The skills you've gained in this class will make you very valuable as an undergrad researcher. Seek out professors who need help in their research projects, and emphasize what you can do.

The point is that in this area, it's less about the formal certifications and more about developing a portfolio that shows how you incorporate all three of the skills.
